## Description of Examples

1. Search articles in Wiki API

A simple NGXS store for three components. The application fetches and displays data from Wiki API. It will demonstrate handling actions as asynchronous entities and practical goals, that can be achieved with Action Handlers. Why subscribe to action immediately after its dispatching, and why subscribe to action in another component.

Used plugins: Devtools
